## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	addresskit "github.com/Boxkit-Labs/stellar-address-kit/packages/core-go/address"
	"github.com/Boxkit-Labs/stellar-address-kit/packages/core-go/routing"
)

func main() {
	// Validate and detect address types
	addr := "GA7QYNF7SOWQ3GLR2B6RS22TBGZAOR6KLYH4PA5ZAM73A3H4K2HZZSQU"
	if addresskit.IsValid(addr) {
		kind := addresskit.Detect(addr)
		fmt.Printf("Address kind: %s\n", kind)
	}

	// Extract routing information from an incoming payment
	result := routing.ExtractRouting(routing.RoutingInput{
		Destination: "MA7QYNF7SOWQ3GLR2B6RS22TBGZAOR6KLYH4PA5ZAM73A3H4K2HZZSQU...",
		MemoType:    "none",
	})
	
	fmt.Printf("Routing ID: %s\n", result.RoutingID)
}
```
